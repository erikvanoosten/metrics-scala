/**
  * A Scala facade class for [[DropwizardTimer]].
  *
  * Features:
  * * measure the execution duration of a block of code with [[time()]]
  * * measure the time until a future is completed with [[timeFuture()]]
  * * add an execution duration measurement as a side effect to a partial function with [[timePF()]]
  * * direct access to the underlying timer with [[update()]], [[timerContext()]], [[count]], [[max]], etc.
  *
  * Example usage:
  * {{{
  *   class Example(val db: Db) extends Instrumented {
  *     private[this] val loadTimer = metrics.timer("load")
  *
  *     def load(id: Long) = loadTimer.time {
  *       db.load(id)
  *     }

  /**
    * Measures 'now' up to the moment that the given `future` completes, then updates this timer with the measurement.
    *
    * *Know what you measure*
    *
    * This method may measure more than is obvious. It measures:
    * * the evaluation of the (by name) parameter `future`
    * * in case the future is not yet completed: the delay until the constructed Future is scheduled in the
    *   given `ExecutionContext`
    * * in case the future is not yet completed: the actual execution of the Future
    * * the time it takes to schedule stopping the timer
    *
    * To only measure the Future execution time, please use a timer in the code that is executed inside the Future.
    *
    * The timer is stopped concurrently to the returned future. If you need to verify the timer's value in a unit test
    * you can use something like ScalaTest's `eventually`, or use a direct execution context.
    * For more information see [https://github.com/erikvanoosten/metrics-scala/pull/144].

    *   def loadStuffEventually(): Future[Seq[Row]] = loadTimer.timeFuture { asyncFetchRows() }
